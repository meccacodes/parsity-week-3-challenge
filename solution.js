// Solution!

// Open only when ready

// 1.	attack() Method:
// •	Bug: name and weapon are not prefixed with this, so they won’t refer to the correct character properties.
// •	Fix: Update to this.name and this.weapon.
// 2.	travel() Method:
// •	Bug: There’s no bug here; this is a “decoy”.
// •	Fix: None, but confirm this function works.
// 3.	forcePower() Method:
// •	Bug: The equality operator is incorrectly written as an assignment (=), and only one equals sign is used.
// •	Fix: Change = to === for correct equality comparison in JavaScript.
